## Syllabus overview

This is a hands-on workshop consisting of five sessions, covering the entire process of creating an R package: functions and data, checking and testing, all levels of documentation, publication and maintenance. 

The material is based on the book *R Packages (2nd edition)* by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan. 
It is [freely availble online](https://r-pkgs.org).

All slides and further resources can be accessed from the [content](modules.qmd) page.
